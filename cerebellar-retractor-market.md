<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebellar Retractor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hand Held Retractors</li><li>Self-Retaining Retractors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cerebellar retractor market is divided into two main types: hand-held retractors and self-retaining retractors. Hand-held retractors require an assistant to hold them in place during surgical procedures, providing flexibility and control for the surgeon. In contrast, self-retaining retractors are designed to maintain their position without manual support, allowing surgeons to operate with both hands free, improving efficiency and precision. These instruments are essential in neurosurgery, facilitating access to the cerebellum and enhancing visualization.</p></p>
